# **AgriTech Cloud Intelligence: Big Data & ML for Smart Farming**

## **Overview**

**AgriTech Cloud Intelligence** is a **cloud-based analytics project** that demonstrates how **large-scale agricultural data** can be **ingested, cleaned, processed, analyzed, and modeled** using **big data and machine learning technologies**.

The project focuses on **soil health analysis (soil pH)** and its interaction with **weather and environmental variables**, highlighting how **cloud-native analytics pipelines** can support **data-driven smart farming decisions**.

This repository is intentionally designed to emphasize **analytics architecture, data workflows, and reasoning**, not just final outputs.

## **Why This Project Matters**

Modern agriculture generates **high-volume, high-variability data** such as **soil nutrients, climate metrics, and sensor readings**, yet actionable insights are often lost due to:

* **Poor data quality**
* **Lack of scalable processing pipelines**
* **Fragmented analytics workflows**

This project addresses those gaps by demonstrating:

* **Scalable cloud analytics design**
* **End-to-end data lifecycle management**
* **Machine learning integrated into big-data workflows**

## **Analytical Problem Statement**

**How can cloud-based big data systems be used to analyze soil and weather data at scale and extract insights that support data-driven farming decisions?**

Key analytical focus areas:

* **Identifying soil pH patterns**
* **Understanding soil–climate interactions**
* **Designing pipelines that scale beyond static analysis**

---

## **Technology Stack**

* **Cloud Platform:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* **Analytics & Storage:** BigQuery
* **Batch Processing:** Hadoop
* **Data Warehousing:** Hive
* **Data Cleaning:** OpenRefine
* **Machine Learning:** PyCaret
* **Large-Scale Processing:** Apache Spark
* **Languages:** SQL, Python

Each tool was selected to reflect **real-world analytics and data engineering architectures**, not simplified academic setups.

## **End-to-End Workflow**

1. **Data Acquisition** – Collected soil and weather datasets from **public agricultural and climate data sources**
2. **Data Cleaning** – Standardized, corrected, and validated datasets using **OpenRefine**
3. **Distributed Processing** – Modeled scalable batch processing using **Hadoop**
4. **Structured Storage** – Organized processed data using **Hive and BigQuery**
5. **Analytical Exploration** – Applied **SQL-based analysis** to identify soil health patterns
6. **Machine Learning Analysis** – Used **PyCaret** to analyze soil pH categories
7. **Scalability Design** – Incorporated **Apache Spark** to represent large-scale and near–real-time processing

This workflow mirrors how **production analytics platforms evolve from batch processing to intelligent systems**.

### SQL & Data Warehousing

Hive external tables and analytical queries were designed to reflect the cleaned soil and weather datasets described in the project report.  
Due to group project constraints, representative schemas and queries are included to demonstrate data modeling and analytics logic aligned with the original implementation.
